**Can you be healed from a trauma so profound that it threatens your very sanity and existence?**

In 2004, a life-changing research investigation unfolds, leaving the author traumatized and blindfolded to the truth. Within the investigation, all aspects of the author's life are judged, including her role as an HIV researcher, a doctor, a wife, a mother, and fundamentally as a human being. The author shares this poignant tale, grounded in reality, but protecting identities by changing the names. Within these pages, themes of blatant discrimination, hysterical Islamophobia, complexities of sexuality, weight of honour and unyielding quest for justice emerge, illuminating the indomitable strength of the human spirit.

This book serves as an act of soul reclamation and healing, striving to shield future generations of professional women from the relentless cruelty that shadows their careers. The narrative unfolds a gripping tale of intra-and inter-institutional conflict, relentless victimization, the shroud of shame and honour, all which threaten to tear the author apart. Yet it is entwined and encompassed in threads of spirituality and the unwavering hope that sustained the author through her darkest hours. It resonates deeply, offering a wellspring of inspiration to women navigating the often male-dominated landscape of academia.

If you want to delve more deeply into a **woman's struggle who dares to take on the world of academic medicine** then read on.

For this is not just her story; it is the story of countless professional women who endure injustice within the workplace. Their voices, their battles, and their enduring strength are woven into every page of this powerful narrative.
