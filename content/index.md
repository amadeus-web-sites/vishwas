# About Vishwas

Persons with mental illness and their families become isolated from society. They have to suffer because of lack of knowledge, misbeliefs, and stigma. There is no other support or guidance available to them apart from the help from doctors. Often the so-called mental illness is a spiritual process which helps in healing and awakening at a very deep level. It is said that the waters in which a mystic swims in are the same waters in which a person with so-called mental illness drowns in. Our attempt is to help them at least float in these waters. We want to provide a space for support without judgment.

Vishwas is an organization where we believe that with support and guidance all persons who are in a spiritual journey but termed as mentally ill, will blossom into their full selves and change the world!

# Why Vishwas

Vishwas is a Sanskrit word that when translated in English has many meanings according to the Collins dictionary. All of these words compoundingly convey what we are trying to provide through this initiative. Firstly, it means 'assurance' and when you give someone assurance that things are ok or they are going to be ok, you are trying to make them less worried. Vishwas also translates into 'confidence' or 'conviction' and here at Vishwas we are trying to nurture that confidence and belief in your thinking and the way you might be feeling.

# What is Spirituality

Spirituality is an acknowledged concept. It involves belief, experience and for some, obedience to an all powerful force usually called God, who resides within each of us.  It involves the ways in which people fulfill what they hold to be the purpose of their lives, a search for the meaning of life and a sense of connectedness to the universe. The universality of spirituality extends across creed and culture. For a lot of persons undergoing the so-called extreme states of consciousness, spirituality is an energy which drives all actions and intentions in a profoundly experiential and transcendent way. At the same time, spirituality is very much personal and unique to each person. It is a sacred realm of human experience. Spirituality nurtures many  qualities such as love, honesty, patience, tolerance, compassion, a sense of detachment, faith, and hope.

Of late, there are some reports which suggest that some areas of the brain, mainly the nondominant one, are involved in the appreciation and fulfillment of spiritual values and experiences. However, universal consciousness is much beyond the physical brain and even our minds.
